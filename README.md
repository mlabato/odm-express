Back-end for e-commerce website "Outlet de Mates". 

After finishing my Full Stack Developer studies at Digital House I was excited about giving my first steps as a web developer, so I contacted an instagram entepreneur, Nicolas, and I proposed him to develop an e-commerce for his business.

After getting in touch with Nicolas' commercial needs, I started this project with an SQL database (odm-db.sql in this repository).
Subsequent to that, I went ahead by creating a back-end service with the following functionalities:

- API for front-end service comsumption (products and users data).
- Database integration with Sequelize.
- Routing with Express.js


Front end repository is hosted on https://github.com/mlabato/odmreact:
